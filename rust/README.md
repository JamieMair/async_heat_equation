## Implementation in rust

### Interesting features

### Neutral features

### Suprising features

* It seems rust comes with minimal functionality and most features need to be installed. For exmaple, [random numbers](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/algorithms/randomness.html) are not available and an external library is needs to be compiled.
