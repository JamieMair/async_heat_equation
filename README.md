This repo is for some small project, to compare [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), HPX, Charm++, Chapel, and go. Recently, I got interested in these languages, 
since I read a lot about them. I mostly use C++ and Python for my research. In this repo, we will implement some 
small code to estimate Pi using the Monte Carlo method.

Next, we implement a solver for the one-dimensional heat eqaution using tasks and asynchronous programming.
