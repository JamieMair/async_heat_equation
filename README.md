## Monte Carlo method to estimate Pi

This repo is for some small project, to learn rust, Julia, and go. Rcently, I got interested in these lamguages, 
since I read a lot about them. I mostly use C++ and Python for my research. In this repo, I will implement some 
small cod eto estimate Pi using the Monte Carlo method. This exmamle is more for educational purposes and for me to 
get some bette runderstanding of these languages.
