## Implementation in swift

### Interesting features

* Swift programming felt like Python prgramming since the syntax looks similar. With some Python knowledge it was quite easy to learn the new language. 

### Neutral features

* Same as [Rust](https://github.com/diehlpk/monte-carlo-codes/tree/main/rust) a combined build sytem and package maanager. A nice feature is that a testing system is integrated as well. 
* Strict type cchecking. 
* Seems mostly used for development of Mac OS X or iOS applications since it is developed by Apple. However, it is Open Source and released using the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) on [GitHub](https://github.com/apple/swift).

### Surprising features

* Installation on Fedora 35 is rather big with `Installed size: 1.4 G` for some programming language. Therefore, swift is excluded from [circle-ci](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/diehlpk/monte-carlo-codes?branch=main) continuous testing to not blow up the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/diehlpk/monte-carlo-codes).
