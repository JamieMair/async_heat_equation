## Implementation in rust

### Interesting features



### Neutral features

* Installation on Fedora 35 is rather bis with `Installed size: 1.4 G` for some programming language.


### Surprising features

* It seems rust comes with minimal functionality and most features need to be installed. For example, [random numbers](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/algorithms/randomness.html) are not available and an external library is needs to be compiled. [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) is the package manager for Rust which downloads and compiles the dependencies. Each [Crate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#crate)  has a `Cargo.toml` file to define all the dependencies.
